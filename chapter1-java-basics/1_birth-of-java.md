# Birth of Java 🚀

Programming languages have come a long way — from writing raw binary instructions to a language that runs anywhere. Let’s walk through this journey step by step 👇

---

### 1. Machine Language (1940s–50s) 💻
![Matrix Binary](https://media.giphy.com/media/l3vR85PnGsBwu1PFK/giphy.gif)

- Programs written directly in `0s` and `1s`.  
- Very hard for humans to understand.  
- Example: `10110000 01100001`  
❌ Tedious and error-prone.

---

### 2. Assembly Language (1950s–60s) 🛠️

- Introduced **mnemonics** (e.g., `MOV A, B`) instead of binary.  
- Easier than machine code, but still **low-level**.  
❌ Hardware-specific and hard to scale.

---

### 3. High-Level, Domain-Specific Languages (1960s–70s) 🌐
- **FORTRAN** → Scientific applications  
- **BASIC** → Education, games  
- **COBOL** → Business applications  

❌ Limitation: Each was **domain-specific** (not general purpose).

### 4. C Language (1970s) ⚡

- General-purpose and efficient.  
- Made **system-level programming** easier.  
- Fast + powerful.  
✅ Huge step forward, but still tied to platforms.

---

### 5. C++ (1980s) ➕➕

- Extension of C with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
- Great for large & complex software projects.  
❌ Still **platform-dependent**.

---

### 6. 1990s: Internet Era 🌍
- Rise of microprocessors and consumer devices.  
- Creating separate compilers for each device was **impractical**.  
- Needed a **platform-independent** language.

### 7. Birth of Java (1995) ☕

- Created by **Sun Microsystems**.  
- Initially for **consumer electronics**.  
- Famous for the principle:  
  👉 **"Write Once, Run Anywhere"**  
- Perfect for the **Internet age** and **cross-platform development**.

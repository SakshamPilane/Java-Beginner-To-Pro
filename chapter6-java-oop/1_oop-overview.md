# 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**.
Objects represent real-world entities and contain **data (variables)** and **behavior (methods)**.

Java is a **pure object-oriented language** (except primitive types).

## 📌 What is OOP?

OOP organizes software design around **objects** rather than functions or logic.

Each object:
- Has **state** (data)
- Has **behavior** (methods)
- Interacts with other objects

## 🌍 Real-World Analogy

| Real World | OOP Representation|
|----------|-------------------|
| Student | Class             |
| Name, Age, Marks | Variables         |
| Study(), Exam() | Methods           |
| Individual student | Object            |

## 🔄 Procedural vs Object-Oriented Programming

### 🔴 Procedural Programming
- Focuses on functions
- Data is shared globally
- Hard to maintain for large programs

Example languages:
- C

---

### 🟢 Object-Oriented Programming
- Focuses on objects
- Data is protected inside classes
- Easy to maintain and scale

Example languages:
- Java, C++, Python

## ⭐ Key Features of OOP

1. **Encapsulation** – Wrapping data and methods together
2. **Inheritance** – Reusing code from parent classes
3. **Polymorphism** – One interface, many implementations
4. **Abstraction** – Hiding internal details

---

## ✅ Advantages of OOP

- Code reusability
- Better organization
- Easier debugging
- High maintainability
- Real-world modeling

---

## 🧠 Why OOP is Important for Developers

- Used in enterprise applications
- Foundation for backend frameworks (Spring, Hibernate)
- Required for interviews
- Helps in system design

---

## 📌 Summary

- OOP models real-world problems
- Java heavily relies on OOP principles
- Understanding OOP is mandatory to become a professional Java developer
